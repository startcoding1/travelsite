      <h2>Top 5 places to visit in Europe:</h2>
      <h3>1. Lake Como</h3>
      <p>Located in the Lombardy region of northern Italy, Lake Como has long been a haven for artists, celebrities and travelers looking to disconnect and truly relax. You'll unwind in no time while wandering down the cobblestone streets, exploring palatial villas and lounging alongside Lake Como's serene shores. Just keep in mind: A stay here won't come cheap, so plan accordingly.</p>
      <h3>2. Vienna </h3>
      <p>This storied Austrian city is best known for its music and monarchs. Explore the Habsburg family's Schönbrunn Palace and its on-site Tiergarten, which is home to the oldest zoo in the world. Art lovers should head to the MuseumsQuartier Wien to peruse the exhibits at the Museum of Modern Art, while music fans will likely enjoy visiting the House of Music and touring or watching a performance at the Vienna State Opera.</p>
      <h3>3. Barcelona </h3>
      <p>Barcelona, Spain's diverse architecture sets the city apart from other European destinations. Antoni Gaudí's Park Güell and Basilica de la Sagrada Família are beyond impressive, as are Palau de la Música Catalana and the many medieval buildings in the Gothic Quarter. When you tire of taking in the city's stunning architecture, relax on La Barceloneta beach, sample a smattering of tasty local tapas at Boqueria Market or sip sangria along Las Ramblas. </p>
      <h3>4. Prague </h3>
      <p>A vacation in Prague will leave you feeling as if you've stepped into a fairy tale. Take in the Gothic architecture and vibrant atmosphere of Old Town Square, and be sure to tour Prague Castle and go for a stroll across the famously scenic Charles Bridge. Prague's affordable food and drinks, accommodations and public transportation make it a great place for travelers who wish to visit Europe on a budget.</p>
      <h3>5. Swiss Apls</h3>
      <p>Located south of Zurich, Bern and Basel, the Swiss Alps are a haven for winter sports enthusiasts. While skiing, hiking and snowboarding tend to dominate this region, you'll also discover quaint towns, serene lakes and gorgeous scenery. Luxury mountain resorts are available throughout the region as well, making it a playground for all sorts of travelers. Additionally, no trip to the Swiss Alps would be complete without indulging in some warm, gooey cheese fondue.</p>

      <h2>Special Tip : </h2>
      <p>One of the most fabulous places to visit is also Albania. A country that has yet to hit the map of most European tourists. Though there is starting to build a buzz about this beautiful country around the Balkans, most of Europe and the world is still pretty unaware of this place.
         With soaring mountains, fascinating valley towns with thousands of years of history, national heroes followed by passionate, prideful people, and a riviera which is up and coming as one of the best in Europe, there is no time to wait – you must visit Albania!</p>
